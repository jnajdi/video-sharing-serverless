This project is based on the A Cloud Guru Serverless workshop: https://github.com/ACloudGuru/serverless-workshop

This is a Serverless web application for sharing videos with the following capabilities:

. User authentication
. Large file video uploads
. A transcoding pipeline, that transcodes uploaded videos to web-friendly 480p mp4 format
. Push-based, event-driven updates to the web-site. Users see new videos automatically, no browser refreshes needed
. The ability to play video files hosted on scalable cloud storage.


Part 1 - Create a serverless transcoding pipeline in AWS
Part 2 - Setup the web site & user authentication (Auth0)
Part 3 - Create an API in the AWS cloud & authenticate calls
Part 4 - Enable browser-based uploads of video files to S3
Part 5 - Connect firebase to list videos
